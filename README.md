# Exploring and analysing Ebay Car Sales Data (2016)
* This is a **Guided Project** form DataQuest.

* In this project I have cleaned and made basic analysis about the Car Sales Data *  
*Below are some conclusions I came up with :-*

### Conclusions
* Ford had the worst milage and was priced more than the competetors thus was not very popular.
* BMW and mercedes_benz gave the best milage and therefore are quite expensive, but still were very popular.
* Volkswagen gave a balance between cost and milage.
* In general cars with higher milage were much more expensive that the cheaper ones.

*** Milage here means the distance that was travelled by the car in it's service time period, the cars with more milage meant that they were more satisfactory to the owner thus used for longer period before selling. ***
